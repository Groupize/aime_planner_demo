# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Summary

## üöÄ Overview

Complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline created for AIME Planner with automated deployment to three environments based on branch-specific triggers.

## üìã What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Continuous Integration** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | PRs and pushes | Testing, validation, security |
| **Deploy Testing** | `.github/workflows/deploy-testing.yml` | Push to `develop` | Auto-deploy to testing |
| **Deploy Staging** | `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` | Push to `staging` | Auto-deploy to staging |
| **Deploy Production** | `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` | Push to `main` | Deploy to production (with approval) |

### 2. Documentation Files

- **`docs/github-actions.md`** - Comprehensive workflow documentation
- **`scripts/setup-github-environments.md`** - Environment setup guide
- **`scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh`** - Automated secrets configuration script

### 3. Updated Documentation

- **`README.md`** - Added GitHub Actions deployment section
- **Environment integration** - Updated with automated deployment flow

## üîß Deployment Strategy

### Branch-Based Deployment

```
develop ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Testing Environment    (Automatic)
staging ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Staging Environment   (Automatic)
main    ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Production Environment (Manual Approval Required)
```

### Environment Configuration

| Environment | Protection | Reviewers | Wait Time | Branch Restriction |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Testing** | None | 0 | 0 min | Any |
| **Staging** | Light | 1 (optional) | 5 min | `staging` only |
| **Production** | Strict | 2+ required | 10 min | `main` only |

## üîê Required Secrets

### AWS Credentials (Per Environment)
```
TESTING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
TESTING_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
STAGING_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
STAGING_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
PRODUCTION_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
PRODUCTION_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### API Keys (Shared)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY
SENDGRID_API_KEY
```

### Rails API Configuration (Per Environment)
```
TESTING_RAILS_API_BASE_URL + TESTING_RAILS_API_KEY
STAGING_RAILS_API_BASE_URL + STAGING_RAILS_API_KEY
PRODUCTION_RAILS_API_BASE_URL + PRODUCTION_RAILS_API_KEY
```

## üö¶ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Set Up Secrets
```bash
./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh
```

### 2. Configure Environments
Follow the guide in `scripts/setup-github-environments.md` to:
- Create GitHub environments (testing, staging, production)
- Set up protection rules
- Add required reviewers

### 3. Test Deployment
```bash
# Test with develop branch
git checkout develop
git push origin develop
# ‚ûú Triggers automatic deployment to testing

# Deploy to staging
git checkout staging
git merge develop
git push origin staging
# ‚ûú Triggers automatic deployment to staging

# Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge staging
git push origin main
# ‚ûú Requires approval, then deploys to production
```

## üìä Workflow Details

### CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Runs on**: All PRs and pushes
- Code linting and style checks
- Unit tests with coverage reporting
- SAM template validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Project setup validation

### Testing Deployment (`deploy-testing.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to `develop`
- Full test suite execution
- AWS SAM build and deploy
- Integration test validation
- Deployment status reporting

### Staging Deployment (`deploy-staging.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to `staging`
- Comprehensive testing
- Staging environment deployment
- Smoke test execution
- Stakeholder notification

### Production Deployment (`deploy-production.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to `main`
- Strict testing requirements (80% coverage)
- Manual approval requirement
- Production deployment with monitoring
- Health check validation
- Deployment tag creation

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Adding New Environments
1. Create new workflow file based on existing templates
2. Add environment-specific secrets
3. Update SAM configuration
4. Configure GitHub environment protection

### Modifying Deployment Process
1. Edit workflow YAML files
2. Test with manual workflow dispatch
3. Update documentation
4. Deploy changes via normal flow

### Monitoring Deployments
- GitHub Actions tab shows all workflow runs
- Each deployment creates detailed logs
- Failed deployments trigger notifications
- Production deployments create git tags

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing secrets**: Run `./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh`
- **Environment not found**: Create in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Environments
- **Approval required**: Check production environment protection rules
- **Deploy failed**: Check CloudWatch logs and AWS permissions

### Support Resources
- Workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
- AWS CloudFormation console for stack status
- CloudWatch logs for Lambda function debugging
- GitHub Environments settings for protection rules

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Run the secrets setup script**
2. **Create GitHub environments** following the setup guide
3. **Test deployments** with each branch
4. **Configure team notifications** (Slack, email)
5. **Set up monitoring dashboards** (CloudWatch)
6. **Review and adjust protection rules** as needed

## üéâ Benefits

- **Zero-downtime deployments** with proper validation
- **Environment parity** across testing/staging/production
- **Automated quality gates** prevent bad deployments
- **Security-first approach** with approval workflows
- **Full audit trail** of all deployments
- **Easy rollback** with deployment tagging
- **Team collaboration** with review requirements

The GitHub Actions pipeline provides enterprise-grade CI/CD for the AIME Planner project with security, reliability, and team collaboration at its core!
