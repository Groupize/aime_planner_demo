## Component Test Details

### 1. Models (23 tests)

#### Conversation Model (`test_conversation.py`)
- **Question Model**: Creation, validation, options, sub-questions
- **EventMetadata**: Event details, planner information
- **VendorInfo**: Vendor contact and service type validation
- **EmailExchange**: Email tracking and metadata
- **Conversation**: Complete state management, business rules

**Key Test Cases:**
- Question answering workflow
- Conversation completion detection
- Email exchange tracking
- Data serialization/deserialization
- Required question validation

### 2. Services (63 tests)

#### Database Service (`test_database.py` - 17 tests)
Tests DynamoDB operations with full mocking:
- Conversation CRUD operations
- Question management
- Batch operations
- Error handling and client errors
- Data consistency validation

#### Email Service (`test_email_service.py` - 16 tests)
Tests email processing with SendGrid and SES:
- Vendor email sending with proper formatting
- Inbound email parsing from SNS/SES
- Email body extraction and cleaning
- Domain verification and receipt rules
- Conversation ID extraction from email addresses

#### LLM Service (`test_llm_service.py` - 14 tests)
Tests OpenAI integration for email intelligence:
- Initial bid email generation
- Vendor response parsing
- Follow-up email creation
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Question formatting for different contexts

#### Rails API Service (`test_rails_api.py` - 16 tests)
Tests external API communication:
- Conversation status updates
- Error reporting and monitoring
- API health checks and retries
- Question formatting for Rails consumption
- Connection validation and timeouts

### 3. Handlers (12 tests)

#### Initiate Bid Handler (`test_initiate_bid.py` - 12 tests)
Tests Lambda function for starting conversations:
- Request validation and parsing
- Service orchestration
- Error handling and reporting
- Database persistence
- Email generation and sending

#### Process Email Handler (`test_process_email.py` - 14 tests)
Tests Lambda function for processing vendor responses:
- SNS event parsing
- Email content analysis
- Follow-up decision logic
- Conversation completion detection
- Error recovery and status updates

## Test Fixtures and Mocking

### Shared Fixtures (`conftest.py`)
- **sample_event_metadata**: Test event information
- **sample_vendor_info**: Test vendor details
- **sample_questions**: Test question sets with various types
- **sample_conversation**: Complete conversation for testing
- **answered_conversation**: Conversation with some responses
- **mock_dynamodb_table**: DynamoDB mocking
- **mock_openai_client**: OpenAI API mocking
- **mock_sendgrid_client**: SendGrid API mocking
- **mock_requests_session**: HTTP request mocking

### Mocking Strategy
- **External APIs**: All third-party APIs are mocked (OpenAI, SendGrid, Rails)
- **AWS Services**: DynamoDB and SES operations are mocked
- **Network Requests**: HTTP requests use mock responses
- **Context Managers**: Proper mocking for batch operations

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Run with verbose output
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_conversation.py

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/unit/models/test_conversation.py::TestConversation::test_conversation_creation
```

### Coverage Reports
```bash
# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate HTML coverage report
python -m pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=html:htmlcov

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Test Scripts
```bash
# Use provided test script
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Use validation script
python scripts/validate-setup.py
```

## Test Data and Scenarios

### Sample Event Types
- **Corporate Retreat**: Multi-day events with accommodation
- **Wedding Reception**: Single-day dining events
- **Conference**: Meeting space and catering combinations

### Question Types Tested
- **Required vs Optional**: Business rule enforcement
- **Multiple Choice**: Option validation
- **Nested Questions**: Sub-question workflows
- **Open Text**: Free-form response handling

### Email Scenarios
- **Initial Outreach**: Professional vendor contact
- **Vendor Responses**: Various response formats and completeness
- **Follow-up Logic**: Smart follow-up generation
- **Email Parsing**: Quoted text removal, signature detection

### Error Conditions
- **API Failures**: Network timeouts, authentication errors
- **Data Validation**: Invalid input handling
- **Service Unavailability**: Graceful degradation
- **Rate Limiting**: Retry logic and backoff

## Mock Data Examples

### Sample Question Set
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Do you have availability for our dates?",
    "required": true
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "text": "What is your rate per room per night?",
    "required": true,
    "options": ["Standard Room", "Deluxe Room", "Suite"]
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "text": "Do you offer shuttle service?",
    "required": false
  }
]
```

### Sample Conversation Flow
1. **Initiation**: Rails API sends bid request
2. **Email Generation**: LLM creates professional outreach
3. **Vendor Response**: Email received and parsed
4. **Answer Extraction**: LLM extracts structured answers
5. **Follow-up Decision**: Business logic determines next steps
6. **Completion**: All required questions answered

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- Tests run on every code change
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Test results integrated with CI/CD pipeline

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Linting and formatting validation

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in appropriate directory
2. Use existing fixtures for consistency
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Test both success and failure cases
5. Update coverage targets

### Test Best Practices
- **Isolation**: Each test is independent
- **Clarity**: Descriptive test names and documentation
- **Coverage**: Test edge cases and error conditions
- **Performance**: Fast execution with minimal dependencies
- **Maintenance**: Easy to update when code changes
